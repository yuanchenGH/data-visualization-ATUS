High-dimension data, such as the ATUS dataset, is challenging to explore. A common practice is mapping the data into low-dimension, called embedding. Embedding can be achieved by dimensionality reduction (DR) techniques. Some popular DR methods mentioned in this class are PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP. I will try all three and compare the results to find the most suitable method in the later sections. In this project, I plan to use the chosen embedding to map the ATUS dataset onto a 2D map. Then this map will be explored to determine what factors (mainly demographic information) affect how Americans spent their time from 2003 to 2021.
Python with Pandas, SciKit-Learn, UMAP, and Matplotlib libraries, is used to preprocess the data and apply the dimension-reduction techniques. Tableau is used to explore the raw data, design visualizations, and construct stories from the data.
